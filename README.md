## üå≥ Navigating the Branches
This repository is branched into several branches.
`main` is for checking in the tasks done in lab class, as well as the one with the most recent updates.

1Ô∏è‚É£ `release/lab` with the corresponding lab number is the final submission for that lab. The code for grading of each lab should be found there.

2Ô∏è‚É£ `topic` branches are for lessons of a specific technique or concept.

3Ô∏è‚É£ `feature` branches contain codes for implementing certain features as required in the lab instruction.


## üìÇ Navigating the Folder Structure
Other branches also have similar structure to `main`, with slight differences. Each folder is as follows:

1Ô∏è‚É£ `aims`: All the codes for the Aims project. Usecase and class diagrams can be found under `requirement` and `design`, respectively.

2Ô∏è‚É£ `others`: Codes for all tasks other than the Aims project.

3Ô∏è‚É£ `painter`: The Painter program required in **Lab 5**
